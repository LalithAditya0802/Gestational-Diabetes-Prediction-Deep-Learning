# Gestational-Diabetes-Prediction-Deep-Learning
This project focuses on building predictive models for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus using Python, TensorFlow, and a hybrid GRU + LSTM deep learning architecture. The SMOTE technique was applied to address class imbalance, helping the model achieve 92% recall and a 90% F1-score, which outperformed Random Forest and XGBoost models.
