## Introduction

**Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)** is a type of diabetes that is first diagnosed during pregnancy. Detecting GDM early is crucial to ensure the health of both mother and baby. This project leverages deep learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of GDM using clinical and demographic data.

---

## Project Objectives

- Develop and train deep learning models for GDM prediction.
- Analyze feature importance and model performance.
- Provide comprehensive documentation, including a project report and educational slides.
- Facilitate reproducibility and educational outreach.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Insert dataset source or description]
- **Features:** Clinical measurements, demographic information, pregnancy-related variables.
- **Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, normalization, feature selection.

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, normalization, encoding categorical variables.
2. **Model Selection:** Experimentation with architectures (e.g., MLP, CNN, RNN).
3. **Training:** Model fitting using training data, hyperparameter tuning.
4. **Evaluation:** Assessment using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
5. **Interpretability:** Feature importance analysis.
